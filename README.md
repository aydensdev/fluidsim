# SPH Fluid Simulation

This is my implementation of a SPH Fluid simulation written in Javascript using WebGPU.  
I have never used WebGPU before and a lot of the code comes from this example:

https://www.wgsl.dev/editor?example=compute-boids

The project is heavily inspired by Sebastian Lague's video on fluid simulations.  
It is also just the base for a future project, in which I would like to:

- Add another dimension
- Merge this project with my raytracer
- Improve rendering (reflections, refraction etc.)
- Clean up and optimize the code

# Usage

Requirements: Support for WebGPU on your browser.

- You can run this project at https://aydensdev.github.io/fluidsim.
- If you want to host it on your computer I recommend using `live-server` from npm.
